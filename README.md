# A Stunning Work in Progress

This is the main repo of the web app I'm building. You may access the current build here:

https://maximum-effort-6q0d19el5-patimus-prime.vercel.app/

I hope to use it in the short term to showcase skills and projects and my beautiful dog. Long term, I anticipate perhaps some informational/educational material on some technologies I've recently used (e.g. Amplify) or some rare diseases I've encountered.
